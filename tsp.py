    Starting from a degenerate tour consisting of the two farthest 
cities, repeatedly choose the non-tour city with the minimum 
distance to its nearest neighbor among the tour cities, and make 
that city the next in the tour. 2-Opt uncrosses any lines in the 
tour until there are no more mor crossed paths, thereby optimizing 
the tour. 2-opt uses a deque to improve the tour moving in both
directions while accessing each next element in O(n) time.
